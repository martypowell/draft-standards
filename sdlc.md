# SDLC
The purpose of this document is to the Software Development Life Cyle standards for Development at Baltimore County

## Iterative Approach
We want to use a sdlc that delivers working software on a consistent basis. Each iteration should contain a set of features that corespond with the alloted time for that weeks development.

## Requirements
Requirements should be stored as Features in TFS. Each feature should include a list of tasks that contain estimates for that task. 

When breaking down tasks, summarize a task so that the minimum estimate is 1 hour. A hour hour estimate entails what you think would take 30 minutes worth of work.
