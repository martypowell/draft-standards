# Agreements
Let's spell out how we work together to:
* Develop a sense of shared responsibility
* Increase members awareness of their own behavior
* Empower the facilitator to lead the group according to the agreement
* Enhance the quality of the group process
* Try and have some fun and enjoy our work

These agreements will work well if:
* They are important to us
* They remain limited in number
* Fully supported by each team member
* Members are reminded of agreements during process checks
* Members are reminded of agreements when they are broken

## Working Agreement
* Be on Time -  Let's not be that group that is late to meetings, lets set the example.  Start meetings on time, end on time, and have an agenda.
* Show Respect - Don't interrupt; let people finish what they are saying. It's okay to disagree with each other. No personal attacks - attack issues; we debate the merit of ideas, not people.
* Communicate - Early and Often. Get to know your peers. Say hi, exchange a bad joke, etc, etc...
* Contribute - Everyone has equal voice and valuable contribution.
* Provide Feedback - Give feedback, receive feedback and act on that feedback. Early and often!
* Learn - Continue to evolve your skills and abilities

## Technical Working Agreement
* Standards - Follow standards when they exist. If they don't exist, get a group together and create them. If they already exist, evaluate within the group and update when needed.
* Version Control - Manage your code-base. Commit your code often. Add meaninful comments to those commits. Branch for features.
* Requirements - Think about requirements, if requirements don't exist, briefly document them.
* Quality Assurance - Ensure tests are performed and results documented. Automate tests when possible.
* Lessons Learned - We are always learning from things that we do, share those things with others and document when appropriate. Everyone will benefit.
